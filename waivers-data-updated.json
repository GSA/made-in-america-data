Part of the specification required the Contractor to provide all management, tools, supplies, equipment, and labor necessary to install two (2) \n2-1/2 ton ductless mini-split Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) units in offices spaces 110A and 110C in building 10. This was part of option four (4) which was exercised 23 November 2021. After awarding the contract, Heffler Contracting Group became aware that the mini-split HVAC systems are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States. NAVFAC SW performed rigorous Market Research to identify domestically manufactured items capable of satisfying the requirement (Encl. 1). The results of the market research demonstrated that the primary places of manufacture for the mini-split HVAC units are foreign. NAVFAC SW seeks to install multiple ductless split system air conditioning units in its operations and computer server rooms at Dixon Naval Radio Transmission Facility (NRTF) and Travis Air Force Base. These units will regulate environmental conditions in areas with specific temperature and/or humidity requirements, such as server rooms where conventional ductwork is not possible.","sourcesSoughtOrRfiIssued":"Yes","piids":[{"piid":"N6237421F5421"}],"isPricePreferenceIncluded":"Yes","waiverCoverage":"Individual Waiver","waiverRationaleSummary":"The Dixon NRTF is part of the Navy’s critical communication infrastructure with equipment that requires specific environmental and temperature requirements to be maintained. The HVAC mini-split air conditioning systems are required.

There is no domestic manufacturer that would satisfy the project needs. Based on the historic cost information currently available, the contracting officer has adequate information to ensure that the cost to the Government for this acquisition will be fair and reasonable. The need for standardization on these buildings is required as these systems are used in computer server rooms throughout the US Military and government offices.","expectedMaximumDurationOfTheRequestedWaiver":"Between 6 months and 1 year","requestStatus":"Reviewed","ombDetermination":"Consistent with Policy","countriesOfOriginAndUSContent":[{"countryiesOfOriginAndUSContent":"","countryOfOriginAndUSContent":{"Two":"JP","Three":"JPN","Numeric":392,"Name":"JAPAN"}}],"solicitationId":"N6247321D1018 X001"},"created":"2022-03-28T20:53:09.312Z","modified":"2022-03-29T19:25:41.067Z"},{"_id":"624314d586709587e612a80b","state":"submitted","data":{"contractingOfficeAgencyId":"1434","contractingOfficeAgencyName":"US GEOLOGICAL SURVEY","fundingAgencyId":"1434","fundingAgencyName":"US GEOLOGICAL SURVEY","naics":{"NAICS_Code":334513,"NAICS_Title":"Instruments and Related Products Manufacturing for Measuring, Displaying, and Controlling Industrial Process Variables "},"psc":{"pscId":781,"pscCode":"6625","pscName":"ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC PROPERTIES MEASURING AND TESTING INSTRUMENTS"},"procurementStage":"Pre-solicitation","procurementTitle":"Twelve (12) GEM Systems GSM-19W Overhauser magnetometers with GPS","summaryOfProcurement":"The GHSC is currently upgrading its geomagnetic data acquisition systems and requires procurement of twelve (12) GEM Systems GSM-19W Overhauser magnetometers with GPS Option A for the USGS Geomagnetism Program Magnetic Observatory network across the U.S. and Guam.

This work spans a broad area covering topics associated with both traditional information technology cybersecurity as well as cybersecurity for mobile networks requiring radio frequency (RF) isolation. This environment ensures that its interior volume is shielded from signals radiated from outside the chamber. Such a shielded research facility can come in the form of either an anechoic chamber or a reverberation chamber. \n\nIn an anechoic chamber, the walls and ceiling inside the chamber are equipped with absorbing material such that signals radiated from within the chamber are absorbed and do not scatter (ideally). In a reverberation chamber, the opposite is true. The walls and ceiling in a reverberation chamber are designed to be reflective (metallic) at radio frequencies of interest. Most anechoic and reverberation chambers are designed, built, and used for testing pursuant to specific electromagnetic capability (EMC) standards (e.g., IEC 61000-4-3). As this chamber will be used for wireless communications research, it is neither feasible nor reasonable to specify the exact application and/or measurements that will take place within the chamber.\n\nThe purpose of this requirement is to obtain a free-standing RF Shielded Chamber for research purposes. Installation shall take place at the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence facility in Rockville, MD.

While American small businesses are found to sell the required chambers, no contractors offering domestic products were identified. \n\nNIST conducted a competitive acquisition on a total small business set-aside basis for a reverberation and anechoic chamber meeting NIST’s minimum specifications. The solicitation was posted with ample time for all potential contractors to submit a quotation for the commercial requirement. The solicitation was later also extended by a week to maximize opportunity for competition. Two quotations were received in reference to the solicitation. Only one quotation, from AP Americas, Inc., was determined to be technically acceptable and this quotation included foreign end products. The other quotation received did not include the required fire suppression system, and was therefore non-compliant with NIST’s required specifications and was technically unacceptable. The only technically acceptable products quoted to NIST are therefore manufactured outside of the United States.  After evaluating all quotations in accordance with the solicitation, the quoter that represents the best value to the Government is AP Americas, Inc., offering foreign end products. NIST intends to purchase a reverberation and anechoic chamber that is primarily manufactured in Germany.
