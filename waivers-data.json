Part of the specification required the Contractor to provide all management, tools, supplies, equipment, and labor necessary to install two (2) \n2-1/2 ton ductless mini-split Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) units in offices spaces 110A and 110C in building 10. This was part of option four (4) which was exercised 23 November 2021. After awarding the contract, Heffler Contracting Group became aware that the mini-split HVAC systems are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States. NAVFAC SW performed rigorous Market Research to identify domestically manufactured items capable of satisfying the requirement (Encl. 1). The results of the market research demonstrated that the primary places of manufacture for the mini-split HVAC units are foreign. NAVFAC SW seeks to install multiple ductless split system air conditioning units in its operations and computer server rooms at Dixon Naval Radio Transmission Facility (NRTF) and Travis Air Force Base. These units will regulate environmental conditions in areas with specific temperature and/or humidity requirements, such as server rooms where conventional ductwork is not possible.","sourcesSoughtOrRfiIssued":"Yes","piids":[{"piid":"N6237421F5421"}],"isPricePreferenceIncluded":"Yes","waiverCoverage":"Individual Waiver","waiverRationaleSummary":"The Dixon NRTF is part of the Navy’s critical communication infrastructure with equipment that requires specific environmental and temperature requirements to be maintained. The HVAC mini-split air conditioning systems are required.

There is no domestic manufacturer that would satisfy the project needs. Based on the historic cost information currently available, the contracting officer has adequate information to ensure that the cost to the Government for this acquisition will be fair and reasonable. The need for standardization on these buildings is required as these systems are used in computer server rooms throughout the US Military and government offices.","expectedMaximumDurationOfTheRequestedWaiver":"Between 6 months and 1 year","requestStatus":"Reviewed","ombDetermination":"Consistent with Policy","countriesOfOriginAndUSContent":[{"countryiesOfOriginAndUSContent":"","countryOfOriginAndUSContent":{"Two":"JP","Three":"JPN","Numeric":392,"Name":"JAPAN"}}],"solicitationId":"N6247321D1018 X001"},"created":"2022-03-28T20:53:09.312Z","modified":"2022-03-29T19:25:41.067Z"},{"_id":"624314d586709587e612a80b","state":"submitted","data":{"contractingOfficeAgencyId":"1434","contractingOfficeAgencyName":"US GEOLOGICAL SURVEY","fundingAgencyId":"1434","fundingAgencyName":"US GEOLOGICAL SURVEY","naics":{"NAICS_Code":334513,"NAICS_Title":"Instruments and Related Products Manufacturing for Measuring, Displaying, and Controlling Industrial Process Variables "},"psc":{"pscId":781,"pscCode":"6625","pscName":"ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC PROPERTIES MEASURING AND TESTING INSTRUMENTS"},"procurementStage":"Pre-solicitation","procurementTitle":"Twelve (12) GEM Systems GSM-19W Overhauser magnetometers with GPS","summaryOfProcurement":"The GHSC is currently upgrading its geomagnetic data acquisition systems and requires procurement of twelve (12) GEM Systems GSM-19W Overhauser magnetometers with GPS Option A for the USGS Geomagnetism Program Magnetic Observatory network across the U.S. and Guam.
