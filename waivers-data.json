The specified purchase is for electrodes that have been designed and tested for reaching deep structures in nonhuman primate, like the amygdala, but still suitable for superficial cortical recordings in nonhuman primates. The specified electrodes are required for three ongoing studies of reward-related circuitry, an essential component of the NIMH mission to understand and develop treatments for behavioral disorders.\n\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this acquisition is to acquire Two (2) of Plexon Inc 32-contact Electrodes and Two (2) of Plexon Inc 64-contact Electrodes or Equal.\n",
