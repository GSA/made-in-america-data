Part of the specification required the Contractor to provide all management, tools, supplies, equipment, and labor necessary to install two (2) \n2-1/2 ton ductless mini-split Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) units in offices spaces 110A and 110C in building 10. This was part of option four (4) which was exercised 23 November 2021. After awarding the contract, Heffler Contracting Group became aware that the mini-split HVAC systems are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States. NAVFAC SW performed rigorous Market Research to identify domestically manufactured items capable of satisfying the requirement (Encl. 1). The results of the market research demonstrated that the primary places of manufacture for the mini-split HVAC units are foreign. NAVFAC SW seeks to install multiple ductless split system air conditioning units in its operations and computer server rooms at Dixon Naval Radio Transmission Facility (NRTF) and Travis Air Force Base. These units will regulate environmental conditions in areas with specific temperature and/or humidity requirements, such as server rooms where conventional ductwork is not possible.",

The facility cannot use a standard split system unit, as an alternative to the ductless split system, because a standard system is incapable of treating ventilation air and the required ductwork cannot be installed in locations that need environmental control. There is no domestic manufacturer that would satisfy the project needs. Based on the historic cost information currently available, the contracting officer has adequate information to ensure that the cost to the Government for this acquisition will be fair and reasonable. The need for standardization on these buildings is required as these systems are used in computer server rooms throughout the US Military and government offices.",

The USGS Earthquake Science Center (ESC) uses nodal seismometers for multiple mission critical purposes, including (a) to detect and locate earthquakes, (b) to locate and detect earthquake faults, and (c) to map locate subsurface groundwater and other resources. ESC currently has about 500 SmartSolo 3C nodal seismometers to conduct the above-mentioned mission-critical work. It is estimated that a minimal of about 1000 SmartSolo nodal seismometers are needed. If DOI does not increase the number of ESC SmartSolo nodal seismometers, parts of ESC’s work will be slower and more inaccurate.",
