2-1/2 ton ductless mini-split Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) units in offices spaces 110A and 110C in building 10. This was part of option four (4) which was exercised 23 November 2021. After awarding the contract, Heffler Contracting Group became aware that the mini-split HVAC systems are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States. NAVFAC SW performed rigorous Market Research to identify domestically manufactured items capable of satisfying the requirement (Encl. 1). The results of the market research demonstrated that the primary places of manufacture for the mini-split HVAC units are foreign. NAVFAC SW seeks to install multiple ductless split system air conditioning units in its operations and computer server rooms at Dixon Naval Radio Transmission Facility (NRTF) and Travis Air Force Base.

The original transponders were chosen non-competitively on the scientific basis that the Sonardyne seafloor transponders were the only transponders that: a) permitted the millimeter to centimeter absolute seafloor positioning resolution required to sense the earthquake cycle seafloor displacements and b) were compatible with the waveglider measuring platform that both our National Science Foundation-funded collaborators and the USGS utilize. The autonomous waveglider platform was a novel technique that replaced an exponentially more expensive option of using an ocean-going vessel to perform the measuring.

This work spans a broad area covering topics associated with both traditional information technology cybersecurity as well as cybersecurity for mobile networks requiring radio frequency (RF) isolation. This environment ensures that its interior volume is shielded from signals radiated from outside the chamber. Such a shielded research facility can come in the form of either an anechoic chamber or a reverberation chamber. 

In an anechoic chamber, the walls and ceiling inside the chamber are equipped with absorbing material such that signals radiated from within the chamber are absorbed and do not scatter (ideally). In a reverberation chamber, the opposite is true. The walls and ceiling in a reverberation chamber are designed to be reflective (metallic) at radio frequencies of interest. Most anechoic and reverberation chambers are designed, built, and used for testing pursuant to specific electromagnetic capability (EMC) standards (e.g., IEC 61000-4-3). As this chamber will be used for wireless communications research, it is neither feasible nor reasonable to specify the exact application and/or measurements that will take place within the chamber.

The purpose of this requirement is to obtain a free-standing RF Shielded Chamber for research purposes. Installation shall take place at the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence facility in Rockville, MD. This is a firm fixed price requirement.","No","[{""piid"":""1333ND22PNB770013""}]","No","Individual Waiver","The results of market research conducted for this requirement demonstrated that the primary places of manufacture for components of reverberation and anechoic chambers are foreign. While American small businesses are found to sell the required chambers, no contractors offering domestic products were identified. 

NIST conducted a competitive acquisition on a total small business set-aside basis for a reverberation and anechoic chamber meeting NIST’s minimum specifications. The solicitation was posted with ample time for all potential contractors to submit a quotation for the commercial requirement. The solicitation was later also extended by a week to maximize opportunity for competition. Two quotations were received in reference to the solicitation. Only one quotation, from AP Americas, Inc., was determined to be technically acceptable and this quotation included foreign end products. The other quotation received did not include the required fire suppression system, and was therefore non-compliant with NIST’s required specifications and was technically unacceptable. The only technically acceptable products quoted to NIST are therefore manufactured outside of the United States.  After evaluating all quotations in accordance with the solicitation, the quoter that represents the best value to the Government is AP Americas, Inc., offering foreign end products. NIST intends to purchase a reverberation and anechoic chamber that is primarily manufactured in Germany.  For the reasons detailed above, there are no domestic products that meet NIST’s specifications.

This research is used for understanding past occurrences and predicting future possible geologic events. Ongoing PCMSC research projects require a more comprehensive and less subjective color assessment of lithostratigraphy (rock/earth layers). Not having seamless integration with the existing MSCL system will require the lab to construct a new standalone core work-flow apparatus and exposes users to (1) substantially longer analysis time requirements, (2) user errors during data collection, and (3) a much higher likelihood of data mismanagement regarding data archive and QMS policy requirements. If a spectrophotometer from an alternate manufacturer was purchased, it would result in significantly increased analysis times and unacceptable delays in completion of science products across a variety of USGS research projects and the acquisition of a replacement system at a cost of approximately $400,000.","Instant Delivery Only","Reviewed","Consistent with Policy",,"[]"
