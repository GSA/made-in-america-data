These studies require electrodes to explore deep structures in the nonhuman primate brain to evaluate the relationship between these structures and primate behavior.  

The exploration of brain regions known to contribute to reward-related behaviors requires different electrode designs depending on the exact region to be studied. The specified purchase is for electrodes that have been designed and tested for reaching deep structures in nonhuman primate, like the amygdala, but still suitable for superficial cortical recordings in nonhuman primates. The specified electrodes are required for three ongoing studies of reward-related circuitry, an essential component of the NIMH mission to understand and develop treatments for behavioral disorders.
